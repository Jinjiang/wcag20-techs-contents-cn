## Status of This Document

_This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the [W3C technical reports index](https://www.w3.org/TR/) at [https://www.w3.org/TR/](https://www.w3.org/TR/)._

This is a <span class="final">Working Group Note</span> "Techniques for WCAG 2.0". These techniques are produced by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/) to provide guidance about how to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/). Techniques are referenced from [Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/) and [How to Meet WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/). Please note that the contents of this document are informative (they provide guidance), and not normative (they do not set requirements for conforming to WCAG 2.0).

WCAG 2.0 Techniques was previously published on 11 December 2008 as a Working Group Note and updated 14 October 2010, 3 January 2012, 5 September 2013, 3 March 2014, 8 April 2014, 16 September 2014, 26 February 2015, and 17 March 2016\. This new version updates the support information provided for WCAG 2.0\. Note that WCAG 2.0 itself remains unchanged, only the informative support materials have been updated. Primary changes include clarifications based on input from the public and translators. Changes in this version include clarifications in techniques [G136: Providing a link at the beginning of a nonconforming Web page that points to a conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/G136), [ARIA2: Identifying a required field with the aria-required property](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/ARIA2) (ARIA) , and [F68: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.2 due to a user interface control not having a programmatically determined name](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F68) .

The changes are highlighted in the [diff-marked version](complete-diff).

The Working Group requests that any comments be made using the options documented in [Instructions for Commenting on WCAG 2.0 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/comments/). If this is not possible, comments can also be sent to [public-comments-wcag20@w3.org](mailto:public-comments-wcag20@w3.org). The [archives for the public comments list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-comments-wcag20/) are publicly available. <span class="final">Comments received on this document may be addressed in future versions of this document, or in another manner.</span> Archives of the [WCAG WG mailing list discussions](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/) are also publicly available, and future work undertaken by the Working Group may address comments received on this document.

Materials from the public to assist in documenting techniques are particularly welcomed. Please use the [Techniques Submission Form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/TECHS-SUBMIT/) to submit techniques.

This document has been produced as part of the W3C [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) (WAI). The goals of the WCAG Working Group are discussed in the [WCAG Working Group charter](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/charter).

This document was produced by a group operating under the [5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/). W3C maintains a [public list of any patent disclosures](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/35422/status) made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains [Essential Claim(s)](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) must disclose the information in accordance with [section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Disclosure).
